# Notes to Deck

**Turn messy notes into polished presentations. In seconds.**

---

## The Problem

You're a creative professional. Ideas flow constantly. Field notes pile up. Research accumulates. Screenshots multiply.

But when it's time to share your work—with clients, collaborators, or yourself—you hit the wall:

> *"I just need to show what I'm working on. Why does it take hours to make it look presentable?"*

The bottleneck isn't the work. It's the presentation.

## The Solution

**Notes to Deck** bridges the gap between raw notes and polished output.

```
Paste your notes  →  Pick a design  →  Download PDF
```

That's it. No design skills required. No learning curve. Just results.
